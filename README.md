Jo - The JVM based Go implementation
=====================================

**This is a pet project.**

And it should be spelled as "Joe", that is - similiar to "Go" the original language we're reimplementing here.

Disclaimer
==========
This is a pet project in order for me to have fun generating bytecode and parsers - I'm fully aware of why/how/when the JVM vs. Go's runtime offer pretty different things.
